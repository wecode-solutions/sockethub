# WebSocket API Documentation

1.  Getting Started
    Step 1: Create an Account

Visit our platform at [Your Platform URL].
Register for an account or log in if you already have one.

Step 2: Create a Project

Navigate to the "Projects" section.
Create a new project by providing a name.
Copy the API key provided for the project. Youâ€™ll use this to authenticate WebSocket connections.

2.  Connecting to the WebSocket Server
    WebSocket Endpoint

        URL: ws://<your-websocket-server-url>:<port>

Authentication

The API key must be provided during the WebSocket handshake using the auth option.

Example: Using Socket.IO (JavaScript)

```javascript
import { io } from "socket.io-client";

const apiKey = "YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY";

const socket = io("http://<your-websocket-server-url>:<port>", {
  auth: {
    apiKey,
  },
});

socket.on("connect", () => {
  console.log("Connected to WebSocket server");
});
```

3. Sending and Receiving Messages
   Send a Message

Event: message
Payload: A string containing your message.

Example:

```javascript
socket.emit("message", "Hello, world!");
```

Receive a Message

Event: message
Payload: A string containing the incoming message.

Example:

```javascript
socket.on("message", (data) => {
  console.log("Received message:", data);
});
```

4. Using Rooms for Project-Specific Communication

Each project has its own channel (room). Once authenticated, the server automatically places the connection into the project's room.
Send a Project-Specific Message

Event: message
Payload: A string containing your message.

Example:

```javascript
socket.emit("message", "Message for my project's room");
```

Broadcast to All Clients in a Room

Event: message
The server will automatically broadcast the message to all clients in the same project room.

Example:

On the client:

```javascript
socket.on("message", (msg) => {
  console.log("Broadcast message:", msg);
});
```

5. Handling Disconnections

The WebSocket connection may be disconnected due to network issues or server conditions. Handle reconnections gracefully.

Example:

```javascript
socket.on("disconnect", () => {
  console.log("Disconnected from WebSocket server");
});
```

6. Error Handling
   Authentication Errors

If the API key is invalid or missing, the server will emit an error during the handshake.

Example:

```javascript
socket.on("connect_error", (err) => {
  console.error("Connection error:", err.message);
});
```

Other Errors

The server may emit errors for other issues.

Example:

```javascript
socket.on("error", (err) => {
  console.error("Error:", err);
});
```

7. Best Practices

   Secure Your API Key: Never expose your API key publicly (e.g., in client-side code or public repositories).
   Reconnect Logic: Implement a reconnection strategy for better reliability.
   Limit Message Size: Keep your messages small to optimize performance.
   Rate Limiting: Avoid sending too many messages in a short period to prevent being throttled.

8. FAQ
   Q: How do I test my connection?

Use the provided example code to quickly test a WebSocket connection.
Q: What happens if my API key is compromised?

Regenerate your API key from the project settings in the platform. 9. Contact Support
